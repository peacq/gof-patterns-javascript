# Design Patterns JavaScript

Collection of 23 (GoF) design patterns implemented in JavaScript using both prototype and ES6 classes.

## Patterns

The patterns can be divided in three different categories

### Creational

Creational patterns provide ways to instantiate single objects or groups of related objects.

* [Abstract Factory](src/creational/abstractFactory) - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. [Read more.](http://robdodson.me/javascript-design-patterns-factory/)

* [Builder](src/creational/builder) - separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. [Read more.](http://dealwithjs.io/design-patterns-the-builder-pattern-in-javascript/)
